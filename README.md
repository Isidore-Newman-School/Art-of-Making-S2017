# Art-of-Making-S2017

### Course Description
This course is a hands-on introduction to the technology and mindsets of making. Projects will introduce students to coding, engineering, and design thinking by leveraging tools like Arduinos, 3D printers, laser cutters, and more. Wearable tech, line-following robots, and electronic music instruments are just a few examples of potential projects created in this course.

***

### Course Objectives

1. Know how to safely operate the tools of the Makerspace, including the laser cutter, 3D printers, and soldering irons.
2. Develop basic 3D modeling proficiency with CAD tools.
3. Develop an introductory-level understanding of object oriented programming, including data types, variables, control structures, and algorithms.
4. Communicate coding’s enormous potential for innovation and creativity, as well as its applicability to a diverse set of careers and disciplines.
5. Understand and apply design thinking principles in the creation of digital or physical prototypes.

### TED Tech Talks
TBA whether or not this will apply this semester...

TED Tech Talks are weekly lectures given by students to educate the class about the diverse applications of coding, important computer science topics not covered in the course, or additional programming languages that are not explored in The Art of Making. Potential topics include:

* Quantum computing
* Machine learning
* Computer science in medicine, music (Max / Jitter, MIDI), art (Processing), or other fields
* Wearable Tech (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, etc.)
* Video Game Design
* Virtual Reality

### Project Evaluation
The following criteria are used to evaluate creative assignments:

* **Meets Requirements**: Does the project follow directions and fulfill all aspects of the assignment? Are materials turned in on time?
* **Correctness**: To what extent is your code free of bugs?
* **Design and Style**: To what extent is your project organized, neat, and well-planned? To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)? To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?
* **Creativity**: To what extent is the project unique, inventive, and imaginative?
* **Effort**: Is there evidence that you invested time and energy in the project?

***

### Late Work
* Late homework or quizzes will not be accepted.
* Late projects will receive a 5 point deduction for each day that the project is late.

***

### Plagiarism
In the age of the internet, and particularly in the realm of computer programming, it is very easy to copy/paste code. **For projects**, sharing code and building off of previous work is permissible, and even encouraged, so long as:
* The code is open source.
* **You give proper credit** by including a comment in your code with a URL or clear description of the source code. Credit is also required for “adapted” code.
* The copied/adapted code **cannot make up a substantial portion** of the project.
* When in doubt, ask!

**Homework and classwork are different**. Unless noted otherwise, these assignments must be **completed individually**. Evidence of copying from other students or plagiarizing existing work may result in no credit, and possibly more serious consequences, as outlined by Newman’s academic policies on plagiarism.
